Open-source teams often begin with a shared goal rather than a shared structure. A project forms around a DAO grant, sponsorships and donations, and ongoing work is funded through a multisig or someone's personal bank account. Most teams have the tools to ship and a way to move money, but not the operational and legal setup to do it safely.

## The Risk You're Already Taking

As soon as money flows, the absence of a legal structure stops being a philosophical choice and starts becoming a practical risk.

Operating without any formal wrapper usually means that real people are exposed by default. If something goes wrong—whether it's a dispute with a contributor over compensation, a misunderstanding about who owns what, or a regulatory question—there is no separate project to respond. Responsibility lands on individuals, often on whoever happens to be most visible or most involved. Even well-intentioned teams tend to underestimate how quickly personal liability can enter the picture once money and ongoing commitments are involved.

## Define It or Have It Defined for You

At that point, teams effectively face a choice. They can leave their activities unstructured and accept that, if a conflict arises, the structure will be imposed from the outside. That structure may come from a plaintiff, a regulator, or another adversarial actor, and it will not be designed with the project's values or operating realities in mind. The alternative is to define that structure proactively, in a way that reflects how the team actually works and allows it to engage with the outside world on its own terms.

## What a Legal Entity Actually Does

For open-source builders and teams working on public goods, this is where a legal entity becomes relevant—not as a symbol of formality, but as a practical tool. At a basic level, a legal structure creates separation between the people involved and the activities they are running. It provides a clear place for responsibility to sit, rather than letting it default to individuals.

A legal entity also makes it possible to interact with the world in a more predictable way. It can sign contracts, hire contributors, and engage suppliers without improvisation each time. When a grant provider asks for an invoice or a contractor needs a formal agreement, there's a clear counterparty to provide it, instead of an awkward scramble to figure out who signs. It can hold a treasury, manage tangible assets, and own intellectual property in a way that survives changes in team composition. For projects meant to outlive any single contributor, this continuity matters.

Just as importantly, structure helps clarify relationships. Internally, it creates clearer expectations around roles, compensation, decision-making and dispute resolution. Externally, it gives DAOs, grant providers, and partners a defined counterparty to work with. Instead of relying on informal understandings, both sides know who they are dealing with and on what terms.

## Structure Doesn't Mean Selling Out

For many teams, adopting a legal structure is not about becoming "corporate." Forming a legal entity doesn't mean you have to raise venture capital, monetize your users, or abandon the open-source ethos. It doesn't require giving up pseudonymity or changing how you build. It means having a container that protects the people doing the work. It is about reducing uncertainty, protecting contributors, and creating a stable foundation for work that is already happening. Once money moves, that foundation stops being optional.
