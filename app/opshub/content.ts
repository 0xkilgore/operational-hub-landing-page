  items: [
    {
      question: "Do I still need someone to run operations?",
      answer:
        "No. The Operational Hub includes workflow software plus an operator team that runs the recurring back office work, like invoicing, payables, approvals, contributor payments, and month-end processes, so you do not need to staff these functions internally.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I still need an accountant?",
      answer:
        "No, not as an internal function. The Operational Hub handles day-to-day finance ops and keeps records organized, including the documentation needed for tax reporting, so you do not need to hire a dedicated accounting role to stay on top of the back office. When tax filings or statutory filings are required, the Hub coordinates with external professionals as needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I still need legal counsel?",
      answer:
        "Sometimes, but far less than a custom setup. The Hub is built on standardized templates and a proven agreement stack, which greatly reduces drafting and repeated reviews. You also get an introduction to MME, a top Swiss firm that helped draft the templates, for cases where you want counsel review or have edge cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do invoicing and payments work (fiat and stablecoins)?",
      answer:
        "The Hub provides a consistent workflow for invoices and payouts. Invoices can be issued through the entity, approvals are collected through a clear process, and payouts can be executed in fiat or stablecoins with records kept in one place for reporting and tax support. The operator team coordinates the workflow and documentation, while your core team keeps approval control.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do setup work and how long does it take?",
      answer:
        "Setup is designed to be standardized and fast. You choose the scope of operations you want covered, complete onboarding and compliance steps, and then the entity and operating workflows are put in place using a proven template stack. From there, the operator team helps you transition invoicing, payouts, records, and month-end routines into the new system. Timeline depends on complexity and required reviews, but the goal is to get you operational quickly without a custom legal build.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we wind this down later?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The Operational Hub is designed to be flexible. You can start lightweight, evolve the setup as your needs change, and wind it down cleanly if it is no longer the right fit, without being locked into a heavyweight corporate structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do members have to be public or doxxed?",
      answer:
        "Not by default. In the standard case, member names do not need to be published in a public registry, which supports privacy-first operations. Some counterparties and service providers, like banks or compliance vendors, may still require identity verification as part of their onboarding.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does liability protection mean?",
      answer:
        "The entity provides a layer of separation so contracts, invoices, and operations can be handled through the organization instead of in a personal capacity. Liability is not absolute. Individuals can still have personal exposure in certain situations, including criminal, regulatory, tax, or employment matters, or cases involving willful misconduct or gross negligence.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the key constraints of the entity?",
      answer:
        "This structure is designed for operating, not fundraising. It does not have shares, cannot pay dividends, and is typically used for service and development activity rather than high-risk financial activity. Commercial activity is generally allowed when it is secondary and supports the stated purpose, and activities like token sales or active trading are usually not a fit.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why Switzerland?",
      answer:
        "Switzerland is a stable, internationally recognized jurisdiction with mature banking and professional services, which makes it well-suited for globally distributed teams that need to sign contracts, issue invoices, pay contributors, and hold IP through an entity. Many crypto and open-source organizations use Switzerland for the same reasons. Zug is a common home base because it has deep talent and service provider infrastructure for these teams.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does tax efficiency mean here?",
      answer:
        "In some cases, a Zug-based structure may pursue a cost plus 5% model via a tax ruling, which can reduce the taxable income tied to operational spend. This is not automatic and depends on your activities and documentation.",
