# Google Ads Strategy - Operational Hub

**Status:** Draft
**Budget assumption:** Test phase, $1-2k/month to start

---

## Strategy Summary

Given this is a service business with a $27k+ annual contract value (Standard tier, 3 seats), Google Ads can work well if we:
1. Target high-intent keywords (people actively looking for solutions)
2. Use aggressive negative keywords to filter tire-kickers
3. Optimize for call bookings, not just clicks

**Goal:** 10-15 qualified calls/month from paid search during test phase

## Ad Copy Concepts

### High-Intent Ads

**Ad 1: Operations Focus**
```
Headline 1: Crypto Back Office for Builder Teams
Headline 2: Invoicing, Payouts, Accounting - Done
Headline 3: Stop Doing Ops as a Side Job
Description 1: Full operations support for teams paying contributors in crypto. Swiss entity + workflows + operator support.

```

**Ad 2: Entity Focus**
```

Headline 2: Own Your Entity. We Run It.
Headline 3: Privacy by Default

## Landing Page Recommendations

**Don't send to homepage.** Create dedicated landing pages for ad groups:

1. **/lp/crypto-ops** - For crypto operations keywords
   - Lead with "Turnkey back office for crypto teams"
   - Show workflow: invoice → approval → payout → books
   - Single CTA: Book a call

2. **/lp/open-source** - For OSS-specific keywords
   - Lead with "Operations for open source teams"
   - Address: grants, sponsors, multiple funders
   - Compare to fiscal hosting
   - Single CTA: Book a call

3. **/lp/swiss-entity** - For entity/structure keywords
   - Lead with Swiss Association benefits
   - Privacy, ownership, neutrality
   - Single CTA: Book a call

## Budget Allocation (Test Phase)

| Campaign | Daily Budget | Monthly | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| High-Intent | $40 | ~$1,200 | Best conversion potential |
| Problem-Aware | $20 | ~$600 | Wider funnel, lower intent |

**Total:** ~$1,800/month

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cost per click | $5-15 | Niche B2B, expect higher CPCs |
| Click-through rate | 3%+ | Benchmark for B2B |
| Conversion rate (click → call) | 5-10% | With good landing pages |
| Cost per call booked | $100-200 | Acceptable for $27k ACV |
| Calls booked/month | 10-15 | From $1,800 spend |

---

## Testing Priorities

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Launch Campaign 1 (high-intent) only
- Test 3 ad variations per ad group
- Monitor search terms report daily for negative keyword opportunities

### Week 3-4: Expand
- Add Campaign 2 (problem-aware) if Campaign 1 performing
- A/B test landing pages
- Adjust bids based on conversion data

### Month 2: Optimize
- Pause underperforming keywords
- Double down on winners
- Consider remarketing for site visitors who didn't convert

---

## Competitor Targeting (Optional)

Could test competitor keywords, but expect higher CPCs and lower conversion:

- "open collective alternative"
- "pilot accounting crypto"
- "deel for crypto"
- "franklin payroll"

**Recommendation:** Test after core campaigns are optimized.

---

## Notes

- This is a "test and learn" budget. If CAC is acceptable, scale up.
- The GTM doc mentions paid search as "medium" investment - this aligns.
- Cal.com booking should have conversion tracking set up (Google Ads + Plausible)
- Consider retargeting blog readers who don't immediately convert

---
