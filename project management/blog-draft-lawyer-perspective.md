## Outline

### Hook (150 words)
- Open with the common scenario: Your open-source project has grown. You have contributors, sponsors, maybe grants. Someone asks "who do I make the check out to?" and you realize you're running a real operation through your personal PayPal.
- The moment every successful open-source team faces: formalizing without becoming a corporation.

### Section 1: Why Legal Structure Matters (200 words)
- **Liability protection** - Personal assets at risk without entity separation
- **Professional credibility** - Sponsors and funders expect invoices from entities, not individuals
- **Banking and payments** - Payment processors increasingly require business accounts
- **Contracts** - Contributor agreements, vendor contracts need a signing party

### Section 2: Common Options Compared (400 words)

#### Fiscal Hosting (Open Collective model)
- **How it works:** Another organization holds funds and provides legal umbrella
- **Pros:** Low barrier, no setup, handles compliance
- **Cons:** No ownership, typically 5-15% fees, limited control, you're a project not an entity
- **Best for:** Early-stage projects testing viability

#### US LLC
- **How it works:** Standard business formation
- **Pros:** Familiar, easy to set up, tax flexibility
- **Cons:** State-specific, personal info public, may not fit non-profit mission, US-centric
- **Best for:** US-based commercial projects

#### Swiss Association (Verein)
- **How it works:** Member-based organization under Swiss law
- **Pros:** Member privacy by default, non-profit friendly, internationally neutral, low ongoing requirements
- **Cons:** Swiss banking can be complex, setup requires local knowledge
- **Best for:** Global teams, privacy-conscious projects, those wanting entity ownership without corporate overhead

#### Foundation (Stiftung/501c3)
- **How it works:** Formal non-profit structure
- **Pros:** Tax benefits, grant eligibility, mission protection
- **Cons:** Heavy governance requirements, slow to set up, restricted activities
- **Best for:** Large projects with significant funding and long-term institutional goals

### Section 3: Key Questions to Ask (300 words)
1. **Do you need to own the entity?** If yes, fiscal hosting is out.
2. **Where are your contributors located?** Global teams benefit from jurisdiction-neutral options.
3. **What's your privacy posture?** Some structures expose member/director info publicly.
4. **What's your funding model?** Grants vs. services vs. sponsorships affect structure choice.
5. **How much operational overhead can you handle?** Some structures require boards, annual meetings, audits.

### Section 4: The Hidden Costs of "Just Winging It" (200 words)
- Personal tax complications when funds flow through individuals
- Inability to sign meaningful contracts
- Loss of sponsorship opportunities requiring formal invoicing
- Contributor payment friction (especially international)
- The informal arrangement that "works until it doesn't"

### Conclusion + Soft CTA (150 words)
- No single answer fits every team
- The right structure depends on your scale, funding, geography, and privacy needs
- Whatever you choose, having *some* structure beats operating through personal accounts
- **CTA:** "If your team is exploring these options, we help open-source teams set up and run Swiss Associations with full operational support. [Book a call] to discuss whether it's right for your project."

## Review Questions for [Lawyer]

1. Is the Swiss Association description accurate? Anything to add about the Verein structure?
2. Are there other structures worth mentioning for this audience?
3. Any legal nuances I'm oversimplifying that could mislead readers?
4. Does the tone feel appropriately authoritative without being salesy?
5. What's your preferred byline/bio?

## Notes

- This aligns with GTM positioning: "You own your entity. We run it for you."
- Targets the "funders requesting clean reporting" and "need to invoice sponsors professionally" trigger moments
- Can be repurposed into LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads
