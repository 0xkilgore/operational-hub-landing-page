# DRAFT: Blog Post - Operator Perspective

**Working Title:** "Stop Doing Ops as a Side Job: The Operations Ceiling Every Builder Team Hits"

**Author:** [Operator colleague name]
**Status:** Draft for review
**Target length:** 1,200-1,500 words

---

## Concept

Practical, relatable piece about the operational growing pains of builder teams. Written from the perspective of someone who's lived it - the chaos of scaling operations when everyone's primary job is building product.

**Tone:** Direct, empathetic, slightly frustrated (channeling the reader's pain). "I've been there" energy.

**SEO targets:** "startup operations management", "paying contractors crypto", "distributed team operations", "open source project operations"

## Outline

### Hook (150 words)
- Start with the scene: It's the last day of the month. You're supposed to be reviewing PRs, but instead you're chasing invoices in Telegram, manually calculating who gets paid what, hoping you remember everyone, and praying the spreadsheet is right.
- Sound familiar? You've hit the operations ceiling.
- This isn't a failure of discipline. It's a structural problem. And most builder teams hit it around the same time.

### Section 1: The "Ops as a Side Job" Trap (250 words)
- In the early days, operations is trivial. One or two contributors, occasional payments, simple tracking.
- Then it compounds:
  - 3 contributors become 7
  - Monthly payments become bi-weekly
  - One funding source becomes three
  - "Just Venmo me" becomes international wire transfers and stablecoin payouts
- The person doing ops (usually a founder or senior contributor) is still doing it "on the side"
- **The trap:** Operations scales linearly with team size. Your time doesn't.

### Section 2: What Breaks First (300 words)

#### Invoicing chaos
- Contributors submit invoices in different formats (or don't submit at all)
- No single source of truth
- Chasing people becomes a monthly ritual

#### Approval bottlenecks
- "Did anyone approve this expense?"
- Founder becomes a blocker because they're the only one who can say yes
- No audit trail, no process

#### Payout nightmares
- Multiple payment methods (fiat, crypto, different chains)
- FX calculations done manually
- "Did that payment go through?"
- Tax documentation? What tax documentation?

#### Month-end panic
- No clear picture of cash position
- Reconciliation takes days, not hours
- Financial reports are either late or fictional

#### Reporting gaps
- Funders ask for reports you can't easily produce
- No visibility into burn rate or runway
- Decision-making based on vibes, not data

### Section 3: The Real Cost (250 words)
- **Time cost:** 10-20 hours/month of founder time on ops (that's 2-3 days not shipping)
- **Error cost:** Missed payments, duplicate payments, wrong amounts
- **Relationship cost:** Contributors frustrated by late or incorrect payments
- **Opportunity cost:** Can't take on certain grants or sponsors because you can't produce clean reporting
- **Mental cost:** The cognitive load of "is everything handled?" never fully goes away

**Key insight:** The cost isn't just money. It's the constant context-switching and low-grade anxiety that comes from knowing your operations are held together with duct tape.

### Section 4: What "Solved" Looks Like (200 words)
- Not zero work, but *predictable* work
- Clear workflows: invoice submitted → approved → scheduled → paid → recorded
- Single source of truth for finances
- Reports generated, not assembled
- Month-end close that takes hours, not days
- The founder's job goes back to being the founder's job

**The key question:** Do you want to *build systems* for operations, or do you want to *build product*?

### Conclusion + Soft CTA (150 words)
- Every team that scales hits this ceiling
- You can solve it three ways:
  1. **Hire an ops person** (expensive, hard to find someone who gets crypto)
  2. **Build internal systems** (takes time away from product)
  3. **Outsource the function** (get the outcome without the overhead)
- There's no wrong answer, but there is a wrong approach: pretending the problem will solve itself
- **CTA:** "We run operations for builder teams - invoicing, payouts, accounting, reporting - so you can focus on shipping. If this resonated, [book a call] and let's see if we can help."

## Notes

- Directly addresses GTM positioning: "Your operations team, without the hire"
- Hits trigger moments: "Recurring contractor payments becoming a burden", "Month-end close is painful"
- Could spawn follow-up posts on specific topics (invoicing workflows, payment rails, etc.)
- Social posts can pull specific sections: "Payout day is a mess" maps directly to Section 2
