# Outbound Outreach Plan

**Owner:** Lumen
**Created:** January 20, 2026
**Goal:** 10-15 qualified calls in first month, 3-5 closed customers

---

## Strategic Context

From KG/LP call (Jan 19): The priority is diversifying revenue beyond Maker. Focus on finding ICP and product-market fit through direct outreach. The Operational Hub is the wedge product - fully managed operations as a service.

**Key insight:** "Go sell your operational hub. Put in the absolute minimum amount of work for Maker and put in all your efforts to find your ideal customer profile."

---

## Target Segments (Priority Order)

### 1. Maker Ecosystem Teams (Warm Leads)
**Why first:** Existing relationships, known pain points, can move fast.

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Jetstream** | Case study | 6 people, distributed. Use as reference (not public). ~$750/person pricing. |
| **Atlas Access** | High priority | "Getting paid a bunch of money, could certainly afford it" |
| Other Maker counterparties | Research needed | Teams with recurring ops burden |

**Approach:** Leverage existing Powerhouse relationships. Position as "operations as a service" they already know works.

**Message angle:** "You've seen how we run ops for [X]. Want the same for your team?"

---

### 2. Open Collective Organizations
**Why:** Clear pain point (15% fee, no entity ownership), easy to identify, public data available.

**Targeting criteria:**
- $50K+ in annual transactions
- Signs of growth/complexity (multiple projects, regular payouts)
- Active in last 6 months

**Research tasks:**
- [ ] Pull list of top Open Collective organizations by transaction volume
- [ ] Filter for crypto/web3/open-source builder teams
- [ ] Identify decision makers (maintainers, admins)

**Target count:** 30-50 organizations

**Message angle:** "Ready to own your entity? Graduate from fiscal hosting to full operations support."

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Org name] - own your entity?

Hi [Name],

Reaching out because [Org] is doing meaningful work and I noticed you're running
through Open Collective.

We help open-source teams graduate to owning their own entity (Swiss Association)
with full operations support - invoicing, payouts, accounting, reporting - so you
keep the simplicity of fiscal hosting but actually own and control your organization.

Unlike OC's 15% fee, we're a flat monthly cost. And unlike setting up your own
entity DIY, we run the operations for you.

Would a quick call make sense to see if it's a fit?

- Lumen
```

### 3. DAO Restructuring Targets
**Why:** Many DAOs/foundations are restructuring. Mid-tier protocols that went DAO-first are now looking for alternatives.

**Profile:**
- Had a DAO or foundation structure
- Moving away from that model (or should be)
- Not the biggest protocols (Uniswap = too big, too far along)
- "A little bit behind the first movers"

**Research tasks:**
- [ ] Identify protocols that have announced restructuring in last 6 months
- [ ] Look for governance forum posts about "operational challenges" or "restructuring"
- [ ] Check crypto Twitter for teams complaining about DAO ops burden

**Target count:** 20-30 protocols

**Message angle:** "Everybody's moving away from the DAO model. Here's a simpler path."

**Template:**
```
Subject: Simpler ops structure for [Protocol]

Hi [Name],

I've been watching the DAO restructuring wave - lots of teams realizing the
governance overhead doesn't match the operational reality.

We run a turnkey back office for builder teams: Swiss entity you own, plus
operator support for invoicing, payouts, accounting, and reporting. Privacy
by default, no token governance required.

If [Protocol] is thinking about restructuring or simplifying ops, happy to
share how other teams have done it.

Open to a quick call?

- Lumen
```

### 4. Privacy-First Builders
**Why:** Swiss Association's privacy-by-default is a real differentiator for this segment.

**Profile:**
- Security tooling, privacy projects
- Politically sensitive work
- Rising public profile = rising personal exposure risk
- Need to sign contracts and invoice without routing through individuals

**Where to find:**
- Privacy-focused crypto communities
- Security research orgs
- Projects that have faced legal/regulatory pressure

**Target count:** 15-20 teams

**Message angle:** "Operate with member privacy by default."

**Template:**
```
Subject: Privacy-first operations

Hi [Name],

Your work on [project] caught my attention. Given the nature of what you're
building, I imagine operational privacy matters.

We help teams like yours operate through a Swiss Association - member privacy
by default, no public registry of who's involved. You can sign contracts,
invoice clients, and pay contributors without routing through personal names.

If that's relevant to how you're thinking about ops, happy to explain how it works.

- Lumen

## ETHDenver 2026 Outreach

**Dates:** February 17-21, 2026 (Stockyards Event Center, Denver)
**BUIDLathon:** Feb 18-21 (virtual start Feb 11)

ETHDenver is the highest-concentration opportunity to meet ICP in person. Builder teams, open-source maintainers, and DAO operators all in one place.

### Pre-Event Outreach (Jan 20 - Feb 16)

**Goal:** Book 10-15 meetings during ETHDenver week

#### Week 1-2: List Building (Jan 20 - Feb 2)
- [ ] Review ETHDenver speaker list - identify teams that fit ICP
- [ ] Check side event calendar (luma.com/ethdenver) for relevant events
- [ ] Cross-reference attendee lists from previous years (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Identify BUIDLathon teams from past years that have grown
- [ ] Note which target orgs (Open Collective, DAO restructuring) will have people attending

#### Week 3-4: Outreach (Feb 3 - Feb 16)
- [ ] Send personalized outreach to 30-40 targets
- [ ] Use "meeting at ETHDenver" hook
- [ ] Book specific time slots (coffee, lunch, side event)
- [ ] Confirm meetings 2-3 days before event

**Pre-Event Template:**
```
Subject: ETHDenver - 15 min?

Hi [Name],

I'll be at ETHDenver and wanted to see if you'd have 15 minutes to connect.

We're building Operational Hub - turnkey back office for builder teams
(Swiss entity + invoicing/payouts/accounting handled for you). Given what
[team/project] is doing, thought it might be relevant.

Happy to grab coffee Tuesday or Wednesday AM, or find time during a side event.

Either way, hope to cross paths.

- Lumen
```

### At ETHDenver

#### Target Interactions
| Type | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Pre-scheduled meetings | 10-15 | Coffee/lunch/side events |
| Opportunistic conversations | 20-30 | Main venue, side events |
| Speaking/panel attendance | 3-5 | Identify relevant sessions, meet speakers after |

#### Daily Structure
- **Morning (9-11am):** Pre-scheduled meetings (coffee spots near venue)
- **Midday (11am-3pm):** Main event - attend relevant talks, work the floor
- **Afternoon (3-6pm):** Side events, workshops
- **Evening:** Networking events, dinners

#### Conversation Approach (60-second version)
1. "What are you working on?" (let them talk)
2. "How are you handling ops - invoicing, payouts, that kind of thing?"
3. If pain: "We run that for teams - Swiss entity, full back office. Want to grab 15 min this week to hear more?"
4. If no pain: "Cool - here's my info if it ever becomes relevant"

#### Qualifying Questions (quick version)
- How many people on the team?
- How are you paying contributors today?
- Who handles the ops/admin stuff?

### Side Events to Prioritize

Focus on events where builder teams and operators congregate:

- [ ] DAO-focused events (governance, operations)
- [ ] Open source / public goods events
- [ ] Builder/hacker meetups (not investor-focused)
- [ ] Privacy/security community events
- [ ] Smaller dinners > large parties (better conversation quality)

**Research task:** Review [luma.com/ethdenver](https://luma.com/ethdenver) side event calendar and flag 5-10 priority events.

### Materials for ETHDenver

- [ ] **Business cards** or contactless share (QR to landing page)
- [ ] **One-pager** (printed, 50 copies) - leave-behind for meetings
- [ ] **Phone-ready demo** - be able to show landing page quickly
- [ ] **Cal.com link** ready to share for follow-up booking
- [ ] **Simple tracking** - notes app or Notion to log conversations daily

### Post-Event Follow-Up (Feb 22-28)

**Within 48 hours of event end:**
- [ ] Send follow-up emails to everyone met
- [ ] Personalize based on conversation ("Great chatting about X...")
- [ ] Include link to book call
- [ ] Add all contacts to CRM/tracking

**Follow-up Template:**
```
Subject: Good to meet you at ETHDenver

Hi [Name],

Great connecting at [ETHDenver / specific event]. Enjoyed hearing about
[specific thing they mentioned].

As mentioned, we run Operational Hub - back office for builder teams.
If the ops burden becomes real for [their project], happy to chat more:
[Cal.com link]

Either way, hope [their project] keeps shipping.

---

## Sales Call Structure

From KG/LP conversation - the demo call approach:

### 1. Discovery (10 min)
- What's your current ops setup?
- How many recurring contributors/vendors?
- What's painful right now? (invoicing, payouts, month-end, reporting)
- What tools are you using today?

### 2. Walk Through Services (10 min)
Go through each domain, describe the problem it solves:
- **Entity:** "You own a Swiss Association - privacy by default, you control it"
- **Workflows:** "Repeatable processes for invoicing, approvals, payouts, reporting"
- **Operator support:** "We run day-to-day so you don't need to"

### 3. Case Study (5 min)
Use Jetstream (for internal calls only):
> "Here's a team - 6 people, half located here, half located there. Didn't know what to do. We organized them, got it running for [X]/month. They're shipping product, not doing admin."

### 4. Fit Assessment (5 min)
- What would you need beyond what I described?
- What's your timeline for solving this?
- Who else would need to be involved in a decision?

### 5. Next Steps
- If fit: Proposal + onboarding timeline
- If not ready: Add to nurture, share content

---

## Tracking & Reporting

### CRM/Tracking Setup
- [ ] Set up tracking spreadsheet or CRM (Notion, Airtable, or similar)

## Appendix: Key Messages

**One-liner:** "A turnkey back office for builder teams"

**Elevator pitch:** "Operational Hub is your operations team without the hire. We combine a Swiss legal entity you own with operator support that handles invoicing, payouts, accounting, and reporting—so you can focus on building, not admin."

**Differentiators:**
- You own the entity (unlike fiscal hosting)
- We run it for you (unlike DIY tools)
- Crypto-native (stablecoin fluency)
- Privacy by default (Swiss Association)
